# Star Wars RPG Game - Jedi's vs. Sith Lords
## How it works
The object of the game is to choose a Jedi and defeat all four of the Sith Lords one at a time. Each of the Jedi's and Sith Lords has a different attack power strength, and the Jedi's specifically will also continue to get stronger (increased attack power) the more attacks they make. It is up to the player to determine the correct order to challenge the Sith Lords so that they are strong enough to defeat all four without dying.
